🛡️ Assignment 2: Detailed Risk Evaluation
Objective: Decomposing identified risks into sub-risks and quantifying them using a Risk Assessment Matrix.

Risk Categories Analyzed:
User Adaptability: Addressing language barriers, accessibility (WCAG), and resistance to change.

Continuous Management: Planning for server costs, tech stack obsolescence, and maintenance.

Unauthenticated Access: Implementing security measures like MFA, SQL injection prevention, and RBAC.

Data Accuracy: Ensuring data integrity through strict validation and automated syncs.

Outdated Information: Managing content lifecycles with automated review triggers and link-checkers.

Evaluation Formula:
	Weight = $Impact (0-5) \times Frequency (0-5)
	$Priority: Determined by the resulting weight to categorize risks as Low, Medium, or High.

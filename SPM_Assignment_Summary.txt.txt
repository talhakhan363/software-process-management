COURSE: Software Process Management
TOPIC: Pre-Development Phase & Risk Evaluation for LMS

===========================================================================
1. PRE-DEVELOPMENT STAGE (GENERALIZED)
===========================================================================
The Pre-Development stage is critical for aligning technical feasibility 
with business goals before a single line of code is written.

Phase 1: Problem Discovering
- Identifying the gap between current state and desired state.
- Conducting stakeholder interviews and observation to find "pain points."

Phase 2: Risk Analysis
- Identifying technical, financial, and operational uncertainties.
- Assessing the probability of failure and planning mitigations.

Phase 3: Development Life Cycle (SDLC) Selection
- Choosing a model (Waterfall, Agile, Scrum) based on project clarity.
- Defining the roadmap and major milestones.

Phase 4: Support & Feasibility
- Determining long-term maintenance requirements.
- Ensuring resources (human and hardware) are available for the project.

===========================================================================
2. WHY A LEARNING MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (LMS)?
===========================================================================
An LMS was selected as the solution during the Problem Discovering stage 
due to the following needs:
- Centralized Resource Management: To prevent data loss and fragmentation.
- Automated Tracking: To monitor student progress and grading efficiently.
- Accessibility: Providing 24/7 access to educational materials remotely.
- Scalability: Handling large numbers of users without manual intervention.

===========================================================================
3. DETAILED RISK EVALUATION (LMS CASE STUDY)
===========================================================================
Methodology: Each risk is decomposed into sub-risks. 
Formula: Weight = Impact (0-5) × Frequency (0-5)

[TABLE 1: USER ADAPTABILITY]
- Sub-Risk: Language Difference | Weight: 25 | Priority: 5 | Treatment: Multilingual Support
- Sub-Risk: Low Accessibility | Weight: 15 | Priority: 4 | Treatment: WCAG UI/UX Standards
- Sub-Risk: Resistance to Change | Weight: 25 | Priority: 5 | Treatment: Incentives/Training

[TABLE 2: CONTINUOUS MANAGEMENT & MAINTENANCE]
- Sub-Risk: Server Cost Overrun | Weight: 12 | Priority: 3 | Treatment: Auto-scaling/Budgets
- Sub-Risk: Tech Obsolescence | Weight: 6 | Priority: 2 | Treatment: Regular Refactoring
- Sub-Risk: Lack of Tech Support | Weight: 10 | Priority: 3 | Treatment: Dedicated DevOps

[TABLE 3: UNAUTHENTICATED ACCESS]

- Sub-Risk: Session Hijacking | Weight: 12 | Priority: 4 | Treatment: Secure Cookies/SSL
- Sub-Risk: SQL Injection | Weight: 10 | Priority: 4 | Treatment: Parameterized Queries

[TABLE 4: DATA ACCURACY & COMPLETENESS]
- Sub-Risk: Manual Entry Errors | Weight: 15 | Priority: 4 | Treatment: Dropdowns/Input Masks
